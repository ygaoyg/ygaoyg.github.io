<div style="text-align: justify;">
We are a cancer epigenomics lab based in the <a href="https://case.edu/medicine/pharmacology/">Department of Pharmacology</a> at Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine. Our research is dedicated to uncovering novel fundamental mechanisms underlying gene expression in cancers. We utilize advanced multi-omics technologies, including high-throughput CRISPR screening, single-cell transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to comprehensively detail the oncogenic mechanisms of transcription factors and identify therapeutic targets for treatment.
